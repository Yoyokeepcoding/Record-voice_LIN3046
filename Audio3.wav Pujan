audio1|I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups
audio2|and asked them whether the drawing frightened them
audio3|But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"
audio4|My drawing was not a picture of a hat.
audio5| It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.
audio6| But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, 
audio7| I made another drawing:
audio8| I drew the inside of a boa constrictor,
audio9|  so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. 
audio10|They always need to have things explained. 
audio11|My Drawing Number Two looked like this:
audio12|The grown-ups' response, this time
audio13|was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, 
audio14|whether from the inside or the outside, 
audio15|and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar.
audio16|That is why, at the age of six,
audio17| I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. 
audio18|I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. 
audio19|Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves,
audio20| and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.
audio21|So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes.
audio22| I have flown a little over all parts of the world; 
audio23|and it is true that geography has been very useful to me.
audio24| At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona.
audio25| If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.
audio26|In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters 
audio27|with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. 
audio28|I have lived a great deal among grown-ups.
audio29| I have seen them intimately, close at hand.
audio30| And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them
audio31|Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, 
audio32|I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One,which I have always kept.
audio33| I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. 
audio34|But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:
audio35|"That is a hat." Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors,
audio36| or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. 
audio37|I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties.
audio38| And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.
audio39|So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to,
audio40| until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara,
audio41| six years ago. Something was broken in my engine.
audio42| And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, 
audio43|I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone.
audio44| It was a question of life or death for me:
audio45| I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.
audio46|The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand,
audio47| a thousand miles from any human habitation. 
audio48|I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean.
audio49| Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, 
audio50|when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:
audio51|"If you please--draw me a sheep!"  "What!"  "Draw me a sheep!"
audio52|I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck.
audio53| I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me.
audio54|And I saw a most extraordinary small person, 
audio55| who stood there examining me with great seriousness.
audio56|Here you may see the best portrait that, later,
audio57|I was able to make of him. 
audio58|But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.
