audio1| James, his sister Sally, and Mark, their BFF (Best Friend Forever) were bored.
audio2| They had played all day but now that it was dark and difficult to see, they had nothing to do.
audio3| They couldn’t play soccer because they couldn’t see the ball.
audio4| They didn’t want to go inside and play a game because it was a beautiful springtime night and they liked being outside, especially after having to play inside all winter long.
audio5| They just didn’t know what to do and it was a little too early for them to go home.
audio6| “I guess I’ll just go home,” Mark said in a sad voice.
audio7| “Aww come on,” replied James.
audio8| “We still have time for another game of – of something.”
audio9| Then Sally said, “I have an idea! Let’s play Hide-and Seek.”
audio10| “I was just going to say that,” James said.
audio11| “Yah, I’ll bet,” replied his sister.
audio12| “You always say you were thinking of whatever I think of,” she snapped.
audio13| “Do not!” James said in a loud voice.
audio14| “Do too,” yelled Sally.
audio15| Mark just looked down at the ground and shook his head from side to side.
audio16| “They are at it again,” he mumbled to himself.
audio17| Then he yelled, “Okay, let’s play Hide-and-Seek. I’ll be the seeker!”
audio18| He turned, faced a big tree, closed his eyes, and started counting out loud.
audio19| “100 – 99 – 98 – 97 …..” Sally and Mark stopped arguing, looked at each other, and ran off in different directions to find a hiding place.
audio20| In the distance they could still hear Mark counting. “4 – 3 – 2 – 1. Ready or not, here I come!”
audio21| Then he turned and began looking for places where they could be hiding.
audio22| Finding Sally was easy. She always ran off and then circled back so she would be close to “base,” the safe place to get to before being tagged.
audio23| Mark looked for the biggest tree and ran towards it. But she wasn’t there.
audio24| “I’ll bet she’s behind that big bush,” he said to himself. So he ran to it and was ready to tag her, but she wasn’t there either.
audio25| As he turned around, he saw James running towards “base” and darted after him.
audio26| Just before he touched James’ shoulder, James tagged the “base” and yelled out “SAFE!” “Did you get Sally yet?” James asked. “No,” said Mark.
audio27| “I haven’t been able to find her and it’s getting late and we need to be heading home.”
audio28| So both boys yelled out “Come on out Sally, it’s late.” But there was no reply. Not even a little snicker from somewhere in the darkness.
audio29| They yelled again. “Come on out Sally, it’s late.” Still there was no reply from Sally.
audio30| They began to worry and started searching for her.
audio31| As they walked around the area they called out “Sally, come on, we give up; you’re safe.” 
audio32| But no matter where they looked, or how much they called out, Sally was wondering what had happened.
audio33| All she could remember was crawling under the big trunk of a fallen tree to hide. 
audio34| Now, as she looked up, she saw several stars through a small hole above her head.
audio35| She had fallen into a hole when she crawled under the tree trunk. 
audio36| “Help!” she yelled and heard her voice echo throughout what must have been a cave. 
audio37| “HELP! Help, help, help!”
audio38| "Did you hear that, James?" Mark said excitedly.
audio39| "Sally just yelled for help."
audio40| "Keep yelling, Sally," James screamed.
audio41| "That way we can find you."
audio42| Sally heard her brother and kept screaming.
audio43| After a short while, the boys were standing next to the big tree trunk.
audio44| "Hey! Are you stuck under this tree?" asked James.
audio45| "Kind of," Sally yelled.
audio46| "When I crawled under it to hide, I fell into a cave. Please help me, I'm scared. It's dark and I can't get out."
audio47| Mark said, "James, you stay with Sally, and I will go get my dad."
audio48| Then he dashed off into the darkness.
audio49| "Don't be scared," James said.
